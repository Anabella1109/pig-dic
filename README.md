## Description
The Pig-Dice game is a fun game based on two players rolling a dice.

A player rolls the die until either:

    1. A one is rolled
    2. The player chooses to hold i.e. stop rolling

When a one is rolled, accumulated points are discarded and the other player takes over the dice.

When Hold is pressed, the accumulated points are added to the player's final Score.

The other player then takes the die over.
